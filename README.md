# SQl-Global-Layoffs-Data-Analysis
I’m excited to share the second part of my SQL project, where I analyzed the cleaned data on global layoffs to discover key trends across different companies, industries, and countries.

Steps involved:

✔ Data Analysis: Used SQL queries to explore the data and identify important patterns. 

✔ Comparing Layoffs: Looked at how layoffs differed between companies, especially in relation to the money they raised.

✔ Ranking Companies: Ranked companies by the number of layoffs to highlight which were most affected.

Different SQL functions were used in:

✅ DENSE_RANK Function: Used DENSE_RANK to rank companies based on the number of layoffs. 

✅ Joins: Combined subqueries to find the name of the companies who laid off maximum and minimum.

✅ Aggregating Data: Used SUM and COUNT to calculate total layoffs by company and industry.

✅ GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses: Grouped data by company and industry and used HAVING to filter results based on conditions.

✅ CASE Statements: Applied CASE statements to know the layoffs before and after 2024.

✅ CTE: Simplified complex queries by breaking them down into manageable parts using CTEs.

Key insights from the analysis:

• Company Layoffs: Tesla, Amazon, Google and Uber ranked among the companies with the highest number of layoffs.

• Peak Year: The year 2023 recorded the highest number of layoffs, making it a particularly challenging year for many businesses. 

• Tesla’s Big Layoff: Tesla had the most significant number of layoffs in a single day in 2024, marking a key event for the company. 

• Transportation Industry Hit Hard: The Transportation industry including companies like Tesla, Uber, Ola faced highest layoffs, indicating struggles within the industry.

These findings provide a clear picture of how layoffs have impacted various companies and industries globally. Understanding these trends can help businesses make better decisions in the future.
